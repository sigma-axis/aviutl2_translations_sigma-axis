# AviUtl ExEdit2 Language Files for Scripts and Filters by sigma-axis

This repository contains language translation files for AviUtl ExEdit2, which enable names and parameters of scripts I publish on GitHub to be displayed in other languages than Japanese.

They take effects only to the scripts I wrote, so it is unlikely to conflict with the translations from other language files.

私が GitHub で公開している AviUtl ExEdit2 用のスクリプトの名前やパラメタを，日本語以外の言語で表示する言語ファイルのリポジトリです．

影響範囲は私の作成したスクリプトに限られているため，他の翻訳ファイルとはまず干渉しません．
